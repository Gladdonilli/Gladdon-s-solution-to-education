<h2><strong><span style="color: #236fa1;">Laws that Affect People with Disabilities</span></strong></h2>
<p>Why do we need laws that are specific to people who have disabilities? First we consider ACCESS: do people with disabilities have the same access to environments, events, and opportunities as everyone else? Then we consider EQUITY: are the experiences the same for people with disabilities as they are for those without? We have laws to facilitate both of these valuable rights. This module will discuss the major laws that affect all people with disabilities; Module 4 will discuss educational laws that affect people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Major Laws</strong></span></h3>
<p>In 1973, Congress passed&nbsp;<a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.eeoc.gov/rehabilitation-act-1973-original-text" target="_blank">The Rehabilitation Act (optional reading),</a> that barred discrimination on the basis of disability in programs that receive federal funding.&nbsp;In 1990, Congress passed the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/ada/" target="_blank">Americans with Disabilities Act (optional reading)</a> to bar discrimination in other areas of society.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="article-header"><strong><span style="color: #236fa1;">Rehabilitation Act of 1973</span></strong></h3>
<section class="entry-content">
<p>The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is the federal law civil right's law that provides grants to states for vocational rehabilitation services, supported employment, independent living, and client assistance. The Rehabilitation Act also funds research activities that are administered by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research and the work of the National Council on Disability. The Rehabilitation Act also includes a set of rules focused on rights, advocacy, and protections for people with disabilities.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #236fa1;">Title I – Vocational Rehabilitation/Rehabilitation Services Agency</span></strong></h3>
<p>Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) services are provided to help eligible people with disabilities (those who want to and can work competitively, which means making at least or above minimum wage, receives the same benefits and opportunities for advancement as other workers, and is in a setting with non-disabled peers). As the main goal of VR is to help disabled individuals obtain and maintain competitive employment, they provide a range of services, including diagnostic evaluations (to determine if the person has a disability and is able to work), vocational counseling and guidance, interest and aptitude testing, job placement assistance, assistive or rehabilitation technology, employer consultation, communication access services (ASL interpreters, oral translators, Communication Access Real-Time (CART) translation, etc.), medical and psychological services, job training, and other services, based on the person’s needs. VR provides these services to any working-aged individual, which means services can start as disabled students are transitioning from K-12 Education to postsecondary environments (i.e., postsecondary education and employment). If it is determined that an individual can and is interested in attending postsecondary education (e.g., career &amp; technical education, 2-year college, or 4-year college) that will facilitate their attainment of competitive employment, VR can provide services including financial aid, coordinating accommodations with postsecondary disability services (such as UIUC's Disability Resources &amp; Educational Services, DRES) and provide other relevant supports, such as assistive technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>State VR programs are funded and overseen by the federal Rehabilitation Services Administration.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #236fa1;">Title V – Rights and Advocacy</span></strong></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Section 501&nbsp;– Federal Employment</strong></span></h3>
<p>Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires the federal government to actively hire and promote workers with disabilities.&nbsp; The regulations for this law require the federal government to provide equal access to training and promotion opportunities, and reasonable accommodations for workers with disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;To file a complaint, federal employees should contact their agency’s Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) office.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #236fa1;">Section 502&nbsp;– Established the Access Board</span></strong></h3>
<p>Section 502 created the United States Access Board.&nbsp; Their duties include: compliance with the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA) standards, developing and maintaining guidelines, and promoting access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) expanded the Board’s mandate to include: developing the accessibility guidelines for facilities and transit vehicles covered by the law; providing technical assistance and training on these guidelines; and conducting research to support and maintain the guidelines.</p>
<p>The Board is also responsible for developing guidelines for accessible telecommunications products under Section 255 of the Communications Act. The Board is also responsible for developing accessibility standards for electronic and information technology for federal agency compliance under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #236fa1;">Section 503&nbsp;– Employers with Federal Contracts or Subcontracts</span></strong></h3>
<p>Section 503 requires federal government contractors (and subcontractors with contracts of more than $10,000) to actively hire people with disabilities and not discriminate against potential employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on Section 503, contact the U.S. Department of Labor,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/">Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs</a>.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Section 504&nbsp;– Federal Agencies and Federally-Funded Programs and Activities</strong></span></h3>
<p>Each federal agency has its own set of Section 504 rules that apply to its own programs.&nbsp; Agencies that provide federal financial assistance also have section 504 rules covering entities that receive federal aid.&nbsp; Requirements common to these rules include reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities; program accessibility; effective communication with people who have hearing or vision disabilities; and new construction and alterations to be accessible.</p>
<p>An example of a policy requiring the provision of qualified interpreters by federal agencies is the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/LAP2018-19.pdf">Social Security Administration Access Policy</a>. If you experience issues with local Social Security offices refusing to provide interpreters or other accommodations, you can refer to SSA’s Access policy or contact the NAD.</p>
<h4><strong>Filing a Complaint under Section 504</strong></h4>
<p>Each federal agency is responsible for enforcing its own Section 504 rules.&nbsp; Section 504 may also be enforced through private lawsuits. You don’t have to file a Section 504 complaint with a federal agency or receive a “right-to-sue” letter before going to court.</p>
<p>Contact the federal agency for more information on filing a complaint.&nbsp; This is a<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ada.gov/investag.htm">list of federal agencies</a><span>&nbsp;</span>investigates disability discrimination complaints against federally funded programs that provide education, health care, housing, transportation, and other services.</p>
<p>You can also find out about filing Section 504 complaints by contacting the U.S. Department of Justice,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/disability-rights-section">Disability Rights Section</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #236fa1;">Section 508&nbsp;– Electronic and Information Technology</span></strong></h3>
<p>Section 508 establishes requirements for electronic and information technology developed, maintained, purchased, or used by the federal government.&nbsp; Section 508 requires federal electronic and information technology to be accessible to people with disabilities, including employees and members of the public.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>The American with Disabilities Act (ADA)</strong></span></h2>
<p>The ADA was passed into law in 1990. ADA is an access law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in all areas of public life including schools, employment, transportation, and all public and private facilities that are open to the general public.</p>
<h3><strong>Who is protected by the ADA?</strong></h3>
<p>The ADA does not provide a list of conditions that are considered to be disabilities. Instead, the ADA defines an individual with a disability as someone who has "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; has a record of such an impairment; or is regarded as having such an impairment"</p>
<p>ADA addresses 5 different areas of public life:</p>
<h4><strong><em>Employment.</em></strong></h4>
<p>ADA demands that people with disabilities have the same employment opportunities and benefits as those without disabilities. Employers are required to provide reasonable accommodations in work settings that have 15 or more employers. A reasonable accommodation is one that does not cause ‘undue hardship” for the employer, this means too much difficulty or expense. Examples of ADA accommodations in the workplace include providing accessible entrances, desks or work materials, adapting work schedules, and providing assistive technology to accommodate the person’s needs.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Public Services: State and local Government</em></strong></h4>
<p>ADA prohibits discrimination the basis of disability by public entities, all programs and services offered must be accessible. “Reasonable Modifications” to policies, practices and procedures may include altering architectural barriers and providing accessible communication mediums for those with hearing, vision and speech disabilities. Title II also covers transportation. Transportation options offered by a state or local government must include accessible options, this includes bus and rail services.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Public Accommodations and services operated by private entities.</em></strong></h4>
<p>ADA prohibits places of public accommodation, including privately owned facilities like stores, restaurants, hotels, movie theaters, medical facilities, gyms, sports stadiums, private schools, daycares etc. from discriminating against people who have disabilities. Title III also sets standards for accessibility for alterations to buildings and constructions of commercial buildings to be ADA compliant. Existing buildings can be required to remove barriers where it doesn’t pose undue difficulty. Title III also requires businesses to have procedures in place to communicate effectively with customers who have vision, hearing, and speech disabilities.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Telecommunications.</em></strong></h4>
<p>ADA requires phone and internet companies to provide a nationwide system of inter and intrastate telecommunications relay services that allow people who have speech and hearing disabilities to communicate via phone. Closed captioned is required for federally funded public service announcements.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Miscellaneous</em></strong></h4>
<p>Provisions including the relationship of ADA to other laws, state immunity, it’s impact on insurance providers and benefits, prohibition against retaliation and coercion.</p>
<h4><strong><em>If you'd like to learn more</em></strong></h4>
<p>Interestingly ADA does not cover plane travel in the same way it does buses and trains. Check out this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/12/10/786559969/wheelchairs-on-planes-why-cant-passengers-use-their-own-onboard">story</a></p>

<h2><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Employment</strong></span></h2>
<p data-eid="2" data-pid="2">Your time at the University of Illinois is a stepping stone to gainful employment that allows you to live the life you choose. According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. everyone has the right to work in just and favorable conditions and to have protections against unemployment (Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948). Why then is there a gap in employment opportunities and labor participation between those who have disabilities and those without disabilities?</p>
<h3 data-eid="9" data-pid="8"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Employment Statistics</strong></span></h3>
<p data-eid="10" data-pid="9">In 2020, 17.9% of people with a disability were employed, down from 19.3% in 2019 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021). For people without a disability, 61.8% were employed in 2020, down from 66.3% in the prior year. Overall, across all age groups and disability categories, people with disabilities are less likely to be employed, and more likely to be underemployed and underpaid than those without disabilities (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021).</p>
<p><strong>Reflection Question (this is for you to consider and is not graded). </strong>What laws do you know about that afford protections to those with disabilities in the workplace?</p>

<p>Before the Americans with Disabilities Act, the United States was a very different place for people with disabilities. Barriers such as inaccessible public buildings and transportation, negative stigmas, unemployment, and underpayment, were faced by many with disabilities. Employers could refuse to hire a person with a disability simply because they had a disability. Today, people with disabilities have rights in the workplace, and some of these rights relate to accommodations. Under ADA, an employer is required to provide reasonable accommodations to an employee or job applicant with a disability, unless doing so would cause significant difficulty or expense for the employer.</p>
<h3 data-eid="73" data-pid="39"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>What is a reasonable accommodation?</strong></span></h3>
<p data-eid="74" data-pid="40">Reasonable accommodations may be changes in the work environment that facilitate a person with a disability performing the duties of a job. Examples of reasonable accommodations may include making the workplace accessible for wheelchair users, or providing a reader or interpreter for someone who is blind or hearing impaired. If an organization has less than 15 employees, or the accommodations would pose an undue hardship on an employer, the organization &nbsp;does not have to provide accommodations.</p>

<p data-eid="78" data-pid="43">Undue hardship means that accommodations would be too difficult or too expensive to provide. An employer may not refuse to provide an accommodation just because it involves some cost, but if the cost is too great, it may fall under undue hardship. An employer does not have to provide the exact accommodation the employee requires and may decide on an alternative option that provides the same access. For example, an employer may install a ramp rather than a chairlift for a few steps into a building. If more than one accommodation works, the employer may choose which one to provide.</p>
<h2 data-eid="82" data-pid="46"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Hiring People with Disabilities</strong></span></h2>
<p data-eid="83" data-pid="47">Since the 1990s, as part of a broad societal shift toward promoting inclusion, independence, and full participation in all aspects of community life for people with disabilities, public policy has provided continued support for the employment of people with disabilities.</p>
<p data-eid="84" data-pid="48">"Today, the employment of people with disabilities is seen not only as a civil rights issue, but also as a practical boon for businesses. Employing people with disabilities has been shown to&nbsp;benefit businesses resulting in lower turnover, increased productivity, and access to a&nbsp;broader pool of skilled workers.&nbsp;For people with disabilities, employment means greater economic self-sufficiency, an opportunity to use their skills, and more active participation in community life" (National Conference of State Legislatures).</p>
<p data-eid="85" data-pid="49">If you want to learn more about initiatives designed to improve employment options and outcomes for people with disabilities, The U.S. Department of Labor's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep" data-eid="86">Office of Disability Employment Policy</a>&nbsp;(ODEP) supports several initiatives that help employers interested in hiring individuals with disabilities including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://askjan.org/" data-eid="89">Job Accommodation Network</a>(JAN) provides free, expert advice on workplace accommodations that may be necessary to assist qualified individuals with disabilities to apply for a job and maximize their productivity once onboard.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://askearn.org/" data-eid="91">Employer Assistance and Resource Network on Disability Inclusion</a>(EARN) is a free, nationwide service that educates employers about effective strategies for recruiting, hiring, retaining, and advancing people with disabilities.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://askearn.org/topics/recruitment-hiring/workforce-recruitment-program-wrp/" data-eid="93">Workforce Recruitment Program for College Students with Disabilities</a>(WRP) is a resource that connects businesses nationwide with qualified job candidates for temporary or permanent positions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-eid="94" data-pid="53"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>People with Intellectual and Other Disabilities and Employment</strong></span></h2>
<p data-eid="95" data-pid="54">Individuals with intellectual disabilities frequently experience additional barriers to employment, such as limitations in learning, speech, communication, social skills, and fine and gross motor skills that may result in functional workplace limitations. All employees require support when starting a job; however, individuals that have &nbsp;challenges learning may require additional supports to learn job skills or on-going support to perform their role successfully. Many individuals with intellectual disabilities benefit from the support of a job coach either on a short- or long-term basis. Other options for "on the job support" include peer/ work colleague support or human resource support.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-eid="96" data-pid="55">Coupled with the societal push for inclusion, there is a recognition of the positive impact of a diverse workplace, including individuals who have autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, and other disorders. "Autism at work" programs are increasingly popular, for example, large technology companies, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://jobs.dell.com/neurodiversity" data-eid="97">Dell</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/inside-microsoft/cross-disability/neurodiversityhiring" data-eid="98">Microsoft</a>, have Autism Hiring Programs where they restructure interviews and the workplace in recognition and respect for neurological differences. Additionally,&nbsp;Microsoft has a focus on inclusive hiring, which reflects their understanding of how a diverse workforce positively affects their company.</p>

<h2 data-eid="94" data-pid="53"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>An Important Case that Affected People with Disabilities' Right to Independent Living</strong></span></h2>
<p>Think about your plans for where you would like to live once you are done with college and ready to move out on your own. Can you imagine the type of place you'll call home? Will you be living with family members? By yourself? Will you own or rent? Live in a city or the country? All of these decisions will be yours to make when you are ready to make them. However, for some people with disabilities, making the decision to live on their own may not be an option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historically, people with significant disabilities were often sent to live in residential institutions rather than remain with their families. Many times, this advice came from medical professionals who believed that the lives of people with disabilities were better served in institutions. It was also believed that families did not have the knowledge or resources to raise and care for a child with a disability. Many parents followed this advice and placed their children with significant disabilities into residential institutions. Thus, for the majority of the people with disabilities, the rest of their lives would be spent living in the institution,&nbsp; having little to no contact with their families. However, some families defied their doctor's advice and made the choice to keep their child at home. One example of someone whose parents chose to raise him at home is Norman Kunc. You can learn more about his story in the <span style="background-color: #c2e0f4;"><strong><a class="inline_disabled" style="background-color: #c2e0f4; color: #0e0600ff;" href="https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/1_m2gcj3qp" target="_blank">following video</a></strong><a class="inline_disabled" style="background-color: #c2e0f4;" href="https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/1_m2gcj3qp" target="_blank"><strong style="color: #030100ff;"> (required)</strong></a></span>.</p>

<p>The Olmstead case started when two women, Lois Curtis and Elaine Wilson, each of whom had mental illness and developmental disabilities, were voluntarily admitted to the psychiatric unit in the state-run Georgia Regional Hospital. At the completion of their medical treatment in the facility, the two women were found ready to move into a less restrictive community-based residential program. However, each of the women remained confined in the institution&nbsp; for several years after the initial treatment was concluded. They filed suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for release from the hospital.</p>
<h3><strong>The Decision</strong></h3>
<p>On June 22, 1999, the United States Supreme Court held in Olmstead v. L.C. that unjustified segregation of persons with disabilities constitutes discrimination in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Court held that public entities must provide community-based services to persons with disabilities when:<br>(1) such services are appropriate;<br>(2) the affected persons do not oppose community-based treatment; and<br>(3) community-based services can be reasonably accommodated, considering the resources available to the public entity and the needs of others who are receiving disability services from the entity.<br>The following judgments were reflected in this Supreme Court decision:&nbsp;<br>First, "institutional placement of persons who can handle and benefit from community settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable of, or unworthy of, participating in community life."<br>Second, "confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment."</p>
