[sounds of children playing] [soft music] [Kris] 
Words are powerful,
they define who we are. If I call you smart, how
does it make you feel? What if I call you stupid? [child] 
Stupid! Does that make 
you feel stupid? Mature people don't 
call each other names. I don't call you stupid 
and you don't call me stupid. Except for when 
you are disabled. And disabled is the only 
name you are calling. [Samuel]
People don't 
label each other. You're just Jim or 
Mary or Sam. Except if you are disabled. [Conner] 
When you have a disability, that's how people describe you. You're no longer short or tall 
or handsome or smart. You are just disabled. The Down syndrome
label prevents me from becoming
who I want to be. Once you are labeled, 
doors close. [Samuel] 
When people
describe themselves, they don't use labels. They don't call themselves 
autistic, pulsing, or retarded. They describe themselves in 
terms of qualities, not labels. [Erik]
Funny, kind, courteous. [Conner] 
Handsome, good-looking, 
and best hair. [Shannon] 
Friendly, um, athletic, happy. [Kris] 
Talented, I'm a hard
worker, and I keep busy. [Kathi] 
Uh, nice, smart and cute. [Darrin] 
Funny, very outgoing, um, 
and, very, very sporty. [Narrator] 
The people describe 
themselves and labels disappear. [Conner] 
The Down syndrome
label allows people to make judgments about me, 
without having to get to know me. [Kris] 
Don't call me dumb, 
I'm a hard worker, which makes me successful. [Darrin] 
I'm proud to be different. When people see I
can play basketball, then they realize I'm just
like everybody else. [soft piano] [Samuel] 
People first language is a movement that wants
to solve this problem. And it asks human,
to get into the habit of describing the person,
before their disability. [Conner] 
Don't call me 
Down syndrome. Call me a person 
with Down syndrome. Or, just Conner. [Narrator] 
By putting the person first, 
you are defining him, or her, as a human being,
not as a medical diagnosis. Another thing to do, is
to describe people not in terms of their
problems, but their needs. [Darrin] 
Don't call me 
a man with CP. Say my needs: 
I use a wheelchair. [Narrator] 
The two sentences
make the same point, but one is positive and useful, and the other brings
 up negative feelings, of inadequacy 
and pity. Words count...
use them carefully. [soft piano outro]
