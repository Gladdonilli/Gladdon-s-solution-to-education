# Issue Brief Assignment - Instructor Video Transcript

## What is the Issue Brief?

An issue brief distills or synthesizes large amounts of information and detail so that the reader can understand the heart of the issue and its context. An issue brief is also intended to address a central issue or point of disagreement.

When choosing a topic for the issue brief, ensure there are at least "two sides or perspectives" you can address.

## Format Options

1. Write out answers to the prompts
2. Audio record yourself addressing the prompts
3. Video record yourself addressing the prompts

## The 7 Prompts

1. What is the topic or issue your brief addresses and how does it relate to disability or persons with disabilities?
2. What are the two main perspectives with respect to this issue?
3. What is the brief history of this issue? What caused this to be an issue? What key events or cultural conversations preceded this issue?
4. What relevant legislation, policies, or case law relate to this issue? (You may need to "zoom out" and think broadly about this connection)
5. Who are the major constituent groups or individuals and their positions with respect to the issue?
6. What do disabled people think about this issue?
7. What is your personal perspective about this issue?

**Note:** Prompts 3-6 should be supported by trustworthy sources. For some prompts, trustworthy sources may include blogs, social media posts, and other informal types of media. If you cite someone on social media who claims to be a legal expert, verify their credentials and share those in your issue brief.

## Citation Requirements

- Include both in-text citations AND a references list
- Use credible sources (Illinois Library Resources recommended)
- If directly quoting or synthesizing someone else's words/ideas, use in-text citations
- Visit Purdue OWL website for citation format guidance (linked in Canvas)

## Topic Requirements

- Must be related to disability (the concept, lived experience, identity of persons with disabilities)
- Be creative and pick something of interest to you
- The two sides/perspectives don't necessarily have to be in contrast; people can have different views on an issue they both support
